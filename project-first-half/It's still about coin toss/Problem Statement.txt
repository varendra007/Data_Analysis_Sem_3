It’s still about coin toss: Your friend has a biased coin at his home and challenges you to determine its bias, 
i.e., the probability of heads. You both have a personal communication system which can transmit/receive bits.
 You ask your friend to toss the coin 10000 times, send a 0 when a tail comes up and a 5 when a head comes up. 
He/she agrees because whatever you receive is anyway corrupted by noise, which has a Gaussian PDF with mean μ 
and variance σ^2. Since you have taken this course and can use some tricks to estimate the noise parameters, 
you put an additional request to your friend and ask him/her to simply send 1000 zeros before sending the coin toss 
results. Using these 11000 samples of data, characterize the noise and then find the bias of the coin (rounded to the 
first decimal place).
